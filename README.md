## Description
As a web development student, I want a tutorial explaining a specific regex so that I can understand the search pattern the regex defines.

## Usage

When you open the tutorial, you will see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile. When you click on the links in the table of contents, you will be taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial.  When you read through each section of the tutorial, you will find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does.  When you reach the end of the tutorial, you will find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile.
